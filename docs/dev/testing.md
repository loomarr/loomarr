# Testing

Unit tests never touch the network. External services are mocked through `internal/testkit` —
extend it rather than writing a private mock.

## The gate

```bash
make check    # fmt + vet + vet-tags + lint + test
```

Green here should mean green in CI.

### `make vet-tags` isn't redundant

Files behind `//go:build ffmpeg|eval|integration` are invisible to plain `go vet ./...` and to
golangci-lint — both ask the build system which files exist, and it honours the constraint.

That blind spot ran for months: `go vet ./...` exited 0 while the tagged run exited 1, and the
one test proving programmes sequence hadn't compiled in several releases. A tagged `go build`
wouldn't catch it either, since `go build` skips `_test.go` and most tagged files are tests.

## The layers

| Layer | Command | Proves | In `check`? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Go unit | `make test` | The backend, hermetically | ✅ |
| Tagged compile | `make vet-tags` | Build-tagged code compiles | ✅ |
| Doc claims | part of `make test` | Help pages don't contradict the code | ✅ |
| Store conformance | `make test-pg` | SQLite and Postgres behave identically | CI |
| Frontend units | `make fe` | Components and domain logic | CI |
| Visual + a11y | `make fe-visual` | Every story, two viewports, pixel + axe | CI |
| e2e | `make e2e` | The embedded SPA through first-run | CI |
| ffmpeg | `make test-ffmpeg` | Programmes sequence through real ffmpeg | manual |
| LLM eval | `make eval` | Real intents against a real model | manual |
| SSO | `make test-sso` | OIDC against real Authelia + Authentik | manual |
| Maintainer smoke | `make smoke` | The real stack end to end | manual |

Store conformance is one suite over two backends — don't fork the assertions per dialect.

Auth tests need the negative cases: members get 403 on titles, approve and admin routes;
sessions die on disable.

## Green that proves nothing

Each of these has happened here:

- **A test that passes first try is suspect.** Sabotage the code and confirm it goes red.
- **`make ci-lint` needs `shellcheck` on `PATH`** — without it, actionlint skips the shell half
  and exits 0 locally while CI fails.
- **A fake that ignores its context** can't catch write-through-dead-context bugs.
- **A story on an unregistered route** snapshots "Not Found" as its baseline and stays green.
- **A pnpm config only fails on a cold install** — with `node_modules` present, pnpm doesn't
  re-evaluate build scripts.

## Determinism

Pod assembly and shuffling take an explicit seed. The visual suite pins the timezone to UTC.
Baselines are Linux-only, generated in the pinned Docker image; local macOS or Windows runs
write differently-suffixed files that are gitignored.

## Fixtures

Fixtures in `internal/testkit/fixtures/` are captures with source-version comments. Write
parsers against them, not against remembered field names — and never let a fixture equate two
distinct identifiers, which has hidden shipped bugs by making a wrong lookup return the right
answer.
